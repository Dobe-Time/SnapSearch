# SnapSearch
Snap Search™
 The user takes a simple image of anything (or anyone), and Snap Search™ will redirect the user to a matching wikipedia page
 for whatever is pictured. The UI will consist of a home page, with an image button moving to the camera, which will then move 
 to another layout (once a picture is taken and verified by the user) that holds a recycler view to scroll between related 
 searches that were found from the picture search. Clicking on the objects in the Recycler-view will take the user out of 
 the app to the items Wikipedia page. This idea stems from the common need for quick information on things in the world. 
 For example, if you do not know the name a tree, with Snap Search™, you would be able to take a picture, know its name, 
 some basic background info, and even related items.
